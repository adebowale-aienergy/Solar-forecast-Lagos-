# Solar Forecast for Lagos

# ☀️ Solar Forecast for Lagos using Machine Learning

This is a starter project that demonstrates how machine learning can be used to forecast solar energy availability in Lagos, Nigeria.

## 🔍 Project Overview

With the increasing need for reliable solar power systems in Nigeria, being able to predict solar energy availability is critical for energy planning, battery storage, and grid integration. This project uses sample data and a basic regression model to explore how we can forecast solar output in a given region.
